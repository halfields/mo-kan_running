# MO-KAN Running

This site is a clearinghouse for footraces in the Kansas City and surrounding areas. Here runners can find upcoming races in chronological order from nearest to most distant dates. Runners can peruse an index of events without logging into the site. They can click on an indivdual event and will be shown the particulars for that event, including name, date, starting time, event organizer, relevant contact information, the URL of the events website (if there is one), and a list of the events races. Event organizers must signup and login and can then fill out forms for their events, can edit or delete their own events, and can view listings of each organizers events.
